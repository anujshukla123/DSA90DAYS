# Day 0: Find the Largest and Second Largest Element in an Array

Welcome to Day 0 of the **DSA 90 Days Challenge** 🚀  
We're starting with a classic — finding the **largest** and **second largest** elements in an array. This problem helps you get comfortable with array traversal and conditional logic.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find:
- The **largest** element
- The **second largest** element (must be

🚀 Approach

    Traverse the array once (O(n) time complexity)

    Use two variables:

        largest

        secondLargest

    Update them on the fly as you iterate

    💡 Edge Cases

    All elements are the same ➡️ No second largest

    Array has less than 2 elements ➡️ Invalid input

    Array with negative numbers? ✅ Still works
